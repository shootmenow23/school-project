    <p>WHAM is a web application allows us to look up events happening around us</p>
    <p>This is an open source software built using open APIs of Eventful and Google Maps.</p>
</div>

<div class="body">
    <p>We are a team of 5 computer nerds (Avengers) at Northeastern University working to make it easier for
        everyone to lookup events happening around them. This is carried out as partial fulfillment of the course
        CS 5500 (Managing Software Development) under Professor Michael Weintraub.
    </p>
    <p>Team Avengers is on a mission to change the way people look for events.
        Do you ever find yourself in a new city with no plans? Ever want to explore a
        new place like a local? Or, are you just looking for an event less mainstream than
        what you are used to? Look no further. The WHAM application will fulfill all of your
        desires. WHAM is an interactive and user friendly map. With it you will never be bored again!
